It's not a lot. But it may help you.\n\nIt all started with the **anomalies**. Locals calling in to talk radio or visiting their doctors with stories of unseasonal weather; impossible objects; half-sightings of unknown creatures; claimed conversations with long dead loved ones. People disappeared. Medical notes describe bodies that started... changing.\n\nWe initiated special containment procedures. Performed tests on those who refused to evacuate. Then, as if reacting to our attention, **The Boundary** appeared and isolated everything and everyone within an area of several square miles. We don’t know if there are still survivors. Or if they're still human.\n\n**Since that moment, not a single expedition has returned.** All lose contact minutes after leaving visual range. We're going on fragments, rumors, and occasional anomalies that seep beyond The Boundary.\n\nWe don’t know what The Zone wants—or *if* it wants. It seems to be a mirror. **It manifests whatever Phobias, Obsessions, and Memories you bring into it.** The Zone brings them to life to test you.\n\nThere are rumors that The Zone can **grant your deepest Wish** if it deems you worthy. Sensor readings show something incredibly powerful at its heart. Perhaps the only escape is the **The Center** itself.\n\nYou are the 14th Expedition. You will almost certainly not return. Good hunting. But prepare to die. The Federal Bureau of Coherence, without admitting liability, thanks you for accepting this mission.\n\n*END MISSION BRIEFING*"
